# RCRSCS
A RoboCup Rescue Simluator Communication Library, initially forked 
from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.jp/projects/rcrscs/releases/p11721).

This is an updated version of the library, with some modifications to
fit newer versions of the RobuCupRescue kernel, as well as containing 
changed modifiers in order of making the library more extensible.
